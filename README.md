# The Forkify app

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that leverages the Forkify API to fetch and display recipe data. This project utilizes Babel for transpiling ES6 code to ES5. Users can search for recipes and save favorites locally for later access. Servings can be adjusted as needed. Users can also add custom recipes which get saved to bookmarks automatically. Added recipes will appear in search results for easy discovery. Overall, Forkify enables recipe browsing and management with smooth UX powered by pure JavaScript and modern tools like Babel.
